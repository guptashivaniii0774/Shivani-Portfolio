          <p>"Hello, I'm Shivani Guptaâ€”a creative soul with a background in banking
            who embarked on an exhilarating journey into the world of IT. Fueled
            by passion, I taught myself the intricate languages of web development,
            and my curiosity led me to join eSkills Web. Here, I've woven my passion
            into projects that aren't just lines of code; they're stories waiting to
            be experienced. Join me on this digital odyssey, where every project is
            a testament to the fusion of self-discovery and the ever-evolving language
            of technology."
